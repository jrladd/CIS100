**Complete by: midnight Sunday on your assigned week, midnight Thursday for everyone**

The purpose of the weekly discussion assignment is to bring current examples of information technology in society into context with the discussions we are having about course material. In this way, we can see connections between historical developments and today’s innovations.

Each week, by midnight Sunday, one or two of you will find a relevant article online and post it to the course blog. You will also write a short paragraph in which you summarize the article and explain why you think it’s important. You should pose a question or two for other students in the class to respond to.

By midnight Thursday of that week, everyone else in the class should write a paragraph responding to each of the posted topics.

In both the originating paragraph and the responses, I want to see at least one integrated quote—from the article, or from another student’s paragraph. This will help us practice one of the most important aspects of writing: integrating sources.

**Requirements**:

- See [Sakai](//sakai.washjeff.edu) for assigned weeks.
- One paragraph (at least four sentences) every week, plus one or two discussion questions if you are the assigned conversation starter
- At least one integrated quote (does not count toward your 4 sentences).
