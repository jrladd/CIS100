**Complete by: the end of every class day marked as "Group" on the [schedule](/CIS100/schedule)*

The purpose of the discussion assignment is to bring current examples of information technology in society into context with the discussions we are having about course material. In this way, we can see connections between historical developments and today’s innovations.

We'll use a private Discord server as our discussion board for the class (I'll post an invite link on Sakai). You'll use the #dr-ladds-section channel as the discussion board, but feel free to use the rest of the server to chat and ask questions as well.

Every time we have "Group" class (i.e. when only half the class meets at a time), you'll also be responsible for posting on the Discord. You will write a short paragraph in which you make a point about one of our assigned readings for that day and explain why you think it’s important.

You can start a new idea or reply to someone's post, but either way your post should have at least 4 complete sentences and an idea that stands on its own. Don't just say "Yes, I agree with your idea." Expand or elaborate on what others have written with your own original thoughts! You can also pose questions to your classmates, but the main part of your post can't be *only* a question.

It's okay to expand on something we discussed in class, but make sure you're not just repeating what we already said.

In all your posts, I want to see at least one integrated quote—from the article, or from another student’s paragraph. This will help us practice one of the most important aspects of writing: integrating sources.

**Requirements**:

- One paragraph (at least four sentences) every "Group" class
- At least one integrated quote (does not count toward your 4 sentences).
